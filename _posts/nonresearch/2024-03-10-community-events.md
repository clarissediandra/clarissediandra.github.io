As an international student intern, I was responsible to organise and lead Global Community Events as a means to enhance inclusivity, particularly among international students in the community.

My Role as an International Student Intern includes:
* Highlighting and addressing concerns, as well as liaising between international students and the Faculty.
* Promoting wellbeing and student support services available for international students.
* Working closely with the employability team to increase the prospects of international students' employment.
* Working together with the communication and equality, diversity, and inclusion interns to promote a sense of belonging within the faculty.

Several examples of the Global Community Events I organised are listed below.
