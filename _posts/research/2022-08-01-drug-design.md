This project aims to evaluate compound libraries of inhibitors as drug candidates by analysing their binding thermodynamics and kinetic parameters with their target protein, GSK3ùõΩ. Specifically, this project utilised in silico docking to identify compounds with the lowest binding energies and in vitro screening to assess GSK3ùõΩ kinase activity and inhibitor effects through biochemical assays. Key data, including binding energy, IC50 values, and inhibitor concentration effects, were obtained and validated using 3D structural analysis. Promising inhibitors are selected for further development, with the ultimate goal of advancing treatments for cell signaling diseases such as cancer.


Protein phosphorylation by serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases is crucial for cellular signaling, protein synthesis, and growth. GSK3 kinase, a serine/threonine kinase, regulates blood glucose levels and cell proliferation through the PKB/AKT and WNT pathways. Dysregulation of GSK3 activity, including GSK3 overexpression or malfunction, is linked to diseases like Alzheimer‚Äôs and cancer, making it a significant target for drug development.

Targeting protein kinases, including GSK3, has become a cornerstone of drug development. Kinase-directed drugs inhibit kinase activity and prevent aberrant binding to natural substrates like ATP or amino acids while preserving essential cellular functions.

This experiment aims to identify and develop potent GSK3B kinase inhibitors. Initially, in silico docking methods will screen a library of compounds to select candidates with the lowest binding energies. Selected compounds will then undergo in vitro biochemical assays to validate their inhibitory effects on GSK3 activity and their potential as therapeutic agents. The combined use of computational and experimental approaches aims to ensure the identification of effective inhibitors, contributing to the development of treatments for diseases linked to kinase dysregulation.

## In Silico Docking

This project aims to identify the best GSK3Œ≤ drug candidates using in silico docking and in vitro biochemical assays. Figure 1 highlights seven top structures that were selected from inhibitor libraries based on their highly negative ligand binding energies, indicating strong predicted interactions with GSK3's active site.

## In Vitro Screening using Biochemical Assays

Experimental validation of the in silico predictions involved biochemical assays to evaluate GSK3Œ≤ activity using two coupled reactions. In the first reaction, GSK3Œ≤ phosphorylated a substrate using ATP, producing phosphorylated substrate and ADP. In the second reaction, the remaining ATP was dephosphorylated during oxyluciferin formation by luciferase, generating luminescence proportional to ATP concentration (figure. 2). As expected, luminescence increased with higher ATP levels and decreased with higher GSK3Œ≤ concentrations, as more ATP was consumed in the first reaction. An outlier at the lowest GSK3Œ≤ concentration (0.0006 ¬µM) was removed due to inaccuracies, which could skew the dose-response analysis (figure. 2b). This finding highlights potential measurement limitations at very low enzyme concentrations.

After validating GSK3Œ≤ activity, a biochemical assay was conducted to test GSK3Œ≤ against the seven selected inhibitor compounds from in silico docking. The supplier's data indicated GSK3Œ≤ should have a specific activity of 245 Units/mg. However, initial assays using 2.5 ng/¬µL of GSK3Œ≤ in a 40 ¬µL reaction yielded 1108 Units/mg (figure. 3). To achieve the target 245 Units/mg specific activity in the same reaction volume, the enzyme concentration needed to be reduced to 0.5 ng/¬µL. Since the enzyme contributes only 10 ¬µL of the total reaction volume, the stock concentration must be adjusted to 2.0 ng/¬µL (a fourfold increase) to ensure proper dilution and experimental accuracy.

During the inhibitor activity and efficacy assay, the most effective inhibitors were expected to reduce GSK3Œ≤'s substrate turnover, leaving more ATP available for luciferase catalysis, resulting in increased luminescence. The IC50 values, which measure the potency of each inhibitor, were calculated to assess their ability to inhibit GSK3Œ≤ activity. A low IC50 indicates a promising drug candidate, while a high IC50 suggests potential toxicity. In this screening, inhibitor 10 (I10) and inhibitor 9 (I9) were selected as the top candidates, showing significant inhibition of GSK3Œ≤ with minimal outlier data. Both inhibitors exhibited a sigmoidal curve, indicating that increasing inhibitor concentration led to greater inhibition of GSK3Œ≤ activity and higher luminescence. I10 was favored over I9 due to its lower IC50, making it a more potent candidate. Other inhibitors, such as I22 and I49, showed downward sigmoidal curves, indicating poor efficacy, while compounds like I16 and I47 had small differences in luminescence, suggesting minimal inhibition, with I16's data failing to produce a valid IC50.

### Conclusion

This experiment successfully identified two potential GSK3 inhibitors, I10 and I9, as strong drug candidates based on their comprehensive evaluation through in silico docking and in vitro biochemical assays. Both compounds exhibited favorable properties, including highly negative ligand binding energies and low IC50 values, indicating their strong affinity and effectiveness in inhibiting GSK3 activity. I10, identified as 6-bromoindirubin-3‚Äô-oxime, emerged as the most potent candidate due to its additional hydrogen bond within GSK3‚Äôs active site, enhancing the stability of the protein-inhibitor complex. In contrast, I9, while slightly less effective, demonstrated stable hydrophobic interactions with key residues, including Lys85, contributing to its inhibitory activity. Both inhibitors showed significantly better binding and efficacy compared to other tested compounds, which were limited by structural incompatibilities or insufficient impacts on GSK3 activity.

The findings highlight the value of combining in silico methods to efficiently screen for candidates with high binding affinity and in vitro assays for validating biochemical efficacy. However, additional validation using advanced techniques like Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) is suggested to provide direct catalytic rate measurements and confirm the inhibitors' biophysical properties. The identified compounds, especially I10, hold promise for further development in preclinical and clinical trials, where their therapeutic potential against diseases like cancer, involving dysregulated GSK3 activity, can be explored. These results underscore the importance of understanding enzyme biochemistry and leveraging modern technologies for targeted drug discovery and development.
