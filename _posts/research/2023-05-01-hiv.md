TODO: PROJECT BRIEF


## HIV-1 Evades Immune Response by Nef-Induced CD4 Downregulation

This set of experiments enabled the determination of the subcellular localisation of Nef protein in GFP transfected HeLa cells using immunofluorescence visualised by confocal microscopy. Furthermore, CD4 quantification by flow cytometry enables to solidify the relation between Nef localisation and the downregulation of CD4 levels to the overall HIV-1 pathogenesis analysis *in vitro*.
