This research aims to understand the function of Nef in HIV-1 infection by characterizing its role in CD4 downregulation and interactions with Hck-SH3 protein, employing biophysical approaches. Despite lacking enzymatic activity and a clear mechanism of action, Nef significantly enhances viral replication and pathogenesis, underscoring its importance in HIV-1 pathogenesis and potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.


The Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 (HIV-1) is a life-threatening retrovirus which interferes with and attacks the immune system of the body. HIV-1 exhibits high transmissibility, a higher risk, and is found as the causative agent of developing Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Currently, no cure or vaccines are available for prevention. The HIV-1 genome consists of 9 open reading frames encoding 15 different mature proteins, which are all involved in hijacking cells of the immune system. Among these proteins, Nef is a pathogenic factor which was found not required for HIV-1 infection but significantly increases viral replication and pathogenesis. Regardless of treatment, untreated patients with Nef-deficient strains of HIV-1 are less likely to develop AIDS, proving the significant effects the proteins must have. The full extent of Nefâ€™s potential has not been recognised due to its lack of enzymatic activity and its poorly understood mechanism of action. Hence, this research aimed to characterise the function of Nef with respect to CD4 downregulation and interactions with Hck-SH3 protein using the biophysical approaches described below.

## HIV-1 Evades Immune Response by Nef-Induced CD4 Downregulation

This set of experiments enabled the determination of the subcellular localisation of Nef protein in GFP-transfected HeLa cells using immunofluorescence visualised by confocal microscopy. Furthermore, CD4 quantification by flow cytometry enables to solidify the relation between Nef localisation and the downregulation of CD4 levels to the overall HIV-1 pathogenesis analysis *in vitro*.

Immunofluorescence was used to co-localize Nef in HeLa cells, visualized using confocal microscopy. HeLa cells' nucleus was stained (blue) with DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole), Nef-GFP transfected cells (green), and anti-Nef antibody (red). Image was further analyzed on an image processor, FIJI.*

## Investigating the Effects of G2A and AxxA Mutations in the Secondary Structure of Nef Protein

This assay utilises Circular Dichroism which served as protein quality control ensuring that mutations introduced in Nef were able to generate proteins that were able to fold properly into its 3D structure similar to its wild-type construct with small structural differences. Once verified, further biophysical characterisation of Nef constructs can be observed.

## Biophysical Characterisation of Nef Protein and Hck-SH3 Protein

To better understand the influence of Nef-SH3 interaction in HIV-1 viral growth, I employed several biophysical assays exploiting the binding ability of G2A Nef and AxxA Nef mutants to SH3 protein using wild-type Nef as a control.

### Utilising an Optical Technique to Monitor Molecular Interactions in Real-Time

This experiment investigates the binding abilities of G2A and AxxA Nef mutants to GST-tagged SH3 protein using wild-type Nef as a positive control analysed using its dissociation constant (Kd) by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR). This optical biosensing experiment relies on the ligand-analyte binding causing a change in the refractive light index detected on a sensorgram. To do this, GST-tagged SH3 protein was immobilised using an amine-coupling reaction on an SPR sensor chip while its analyte, Nef proteins (wild-type and mutants) flowed on the surface at different lanes in three different concentrations. Results showed that the binding affinity between Nef-SH3 protein interactions are concentration-dependent. Moreover, Nef mutants showed altered affinity to SH3: AxxA Nef mutant completely diminished binding of Nef to SH3 while G2A Nef mutant reduced binding to SH3 by half.

### Quantitative Analysis of Nef-SH3 Interactions to Deduce the Specific Nef-SH3 Binding Interface

NMR experiment was carried out to elucidate the effects upon binding of wild-type Nef binding to SH3 protein compared to apo Nef on its local chemical environment as an attempt to deduce the Nef-SH3 binding interface. Here, Nef was 15N-labelled, expressed and purified whereas SH3 remained untagged. Changes recorded reflect residual shifts of Nef upon its binding to SH3. Afterwards, its CSP value was analysed and any significant changes in residual chemical shift were highlighted and visualised in 3D molecular structure using PyMOL software.
