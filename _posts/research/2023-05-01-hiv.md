Research aims to understand the function of Nef in HIV-1 infection by characterizing its role in CD4 downregulation and interactions with Hck-SH3 protein, employing biophysical approaches. Despite lacking enzymatic activity and a clear mechanism of action, Nef significantly enhances viral replication and pathogenesis, underscoring its importance in HIV-1 pathogenesis and potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.


The Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 (HIV-1) is a life-threatening retrovirus which interferes with and attacks the immune system of the body. HIV-1 exhibits high transmissibility, a higher risk, and is found as the causative agent of developing Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Currently, no cure or vaccines are available for prevention. The HIV-1 genome consists of 9 open reading frames encoding 15 different mature proteins, which are all involved in hijacking cells of the immune system. Among these proteins, Nef is a pathogenic factor which was found not required for HIV-1 infection but significantly increases viral replication and pathogenesis. Regardless of treatment, untreated patients with Nef-deficient strains of HIV-1 are less likely to develop AIDS, proving the significant effects the proteins must have. The full extent of Nefâ€™s potential has not been recognised due to its lack of enzymatic activity and its poorly understood mechanism of action. Hence, this research aimed to characterise the function of Nef with respect to CD4 downregulation and interactions with Hck-SH3 protein using the biophysical approaches described below.


## HIV-1 Evades Immune Response by Nef-Induced CD4 Downregulation

This set of experiments enabled the determination of the subcellular localisation of Nef protein in GFP-transfected HeLa cells using immunofluorescence visualised by confocal microscopy. Furthermore, CD4 quantification by flow cytometry enables to solidify the relation between Nef localisation and the downregulation of CD4 levels to the overall HIV-1 pathogenesis analysis *in vitro*.

Image was further analyzed on an image processor, FIJI.

## Investigating the Effects of G2A and AxxA Mutations in the Secondary Structure of Nef Protein

This assay utilises Circular Dichroism which served as protein quality control ensuring that mutations introduced in Nef were able to generate proteins that were able to fold properly into its 3D structure similar to its wild-type construct with small structural differences. Once verified, further biophysical characterisation of Nef constructs can be observed.
