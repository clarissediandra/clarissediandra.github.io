 This literature review explores the pivotal role of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) in breast cancer carcinogenesis, prompting the exploration of UPR-targeting drugs, particularly those aimed at IRE1 and PERK, for effective anti-BC therapy.


The Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), a pivotal regulator of proteostasis in the Endoplasmic Reticulum, remains dormant under normal conditions but activates during ER stress, notably in diseases like breast cancer (BC). Recent research highlights the significant impact of UPR on BC carcinogenesis, paving the way for promising UPR-targeting drugs as effective treatments, either in combination therapy to prevent tumour relapses or as standalone treatments, thus advancing the quest for less invasive anti-BC therapy, as discussed in this review focusing on IRE1 and PERK targeting for anti-BC therapy.

## Breast Cancer Hallmarks

Breast cancer, a widely studied life-threatening disease, is a malignant condition of the mammary glands characterized by the accumulation of uncontrollable and undifferentiated cells forming lumps capable of metastasising through the blood or lymphatic system. Based on pathology, most cases are categorized as carcinoma, with a minority as sarcoma, and further classification involves molecular markers such as hormone receptors (Estrogen (EsR+) and Progesterone (PR+)) and Human Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2), leading to four subtypes: Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2+, and Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC). TNBC, lacking therapeutic targets, presents challenges in treatment, being more aggressive and prone to relapses. Breast cancer, like other cancers, relies on various cellular signalling pathways, including the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), to maintain its survival hallmark.

Progression of normal breast cancer cells into its invasive carcinoma state influenced by genetic (increasing oncogene expressions or loss of tumor suppressing genes), epigenetic (alteration in DNA structure), and microenvironment factors (loss of immune response, etc). Tumor remains ‘in situ’ until the intraductal carcinoma stage. Tumor invasion only starts from the invasive ductal carcinoma stage. Once a tumor spreads via blood or lymphatic system, it is called “metastatic cancers”. (B).Breast cancer cell hallmarks, essential for its survival, invasion, and metastasis.*

## UPR Pathways

UPR activation, involving three stress sensors (IRE1α, PERK, and ATF6), is essential to mitigate normal proteostasis by relieving Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress arising from the accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins. It balances protein synthesis demand and folding capacity by stimulating more chaperone production, protein degradation, or inhibiting translation.

IRE1 is a type I transmembrane protein comprising an endoribonuclease and a serine/threonine kinase domain in its C-terminus. In response to ER stress, IRE1 oligomerizes, triggering trans-autophosphorylation and activating its RNase domain, which can stimulate either cell survival or apoptosis. Its RNase activity permits both functions by a spliceosome-independent cleavage of a 26-nucleotide unspliced XBox binding Protein 1 (XBP1u) mRNA intron, yielding spliced XBP1 (XBP1s) mRNA, promoting cell survival by permitting more chaperone and lipid biosynthesis enzyme expressions and inducing apoptosis by increasing ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) component expressions. Furthermore, its RNase-induced apoptosis stimulates IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD), targeting ribosomal RNAs, microRNAs, and ER-localized RNAs. Meanwhile, IRE1 kinase activity only stimulates apoptosis by recruiting TRAF2, which either activates c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) or translocates NF-kB to the nucleus, expressing inflammatory cytokines as pro-tumorigenic factors. Downstream, these cytokines can induce the production of pro-angiogenic factors like Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF).

Like IRE1, PERK is also a type I transmembrane protein with a serine/threonine kinase domain. Upon ER stress, PERK is activated and oligomerizes, phosphorylating the serine-51 residue of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (elf2α), which inhibits protein translation, leading to an increase in ATF4 translation. ATF4 enhances gene expressions for improved ER folding capacity and autophagy, while also upregulating pro-apoptotic proteins like Bax through CHOP induction, and restoring protein synthesis by dephosphorylating elf2α-p via GADD34 upregulation. This flexibility in elf2α phosphorylation allows PERK to respond to both acute and chronic ER stress, managing tumour microenvironments and cell cycle checkpoint components critical in cancers. UPR plays a critical role in cellular progression and signalling transduction, especially in cancers, proposing the idea of exploiting UPR in breast cancer therapy.

Understanding the role of UPR in breast cancer is crucial for developing anti-breast cancer drugs with high efficacy and low relapse properties, aiming to investigate the effects of activating or suppressing IRE1 and PERK pathways in existing resistance-prone breast cancer therapies and discussing potential UPR-targeting inhibitors as alternative single therapies to existing multiple breast cancer treatments.

*(A). Illustrates the IRE1 activation pathway. Upon ER stress, active IRE1 dimer exhibits RNase and Kinase function. RNase activity permits splicing of unspliced X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1u) mRNA into spliced XBP1 (XBP1s) mRNA which translocates to the nucleus, expressing both chaperones and lipid biosynthesis enzymes. Moreover, it increases RIDD process. Kinase activity phosphorylates both c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) and NF-kB by TRAF2. Activated NF-kB translocates to the nucleus to express genes increasing cytokine production. (B). Illustrates the PERK activation pathway. Upon ER stress, active PERK dimer phosphorylates elf2α (eukaryotic initiation factor 2α) leading to ATF4 expression which will later translocate to the nucleus to express genes in response to ER stress: chaperones (increase folding capacity), CHOP and Bax (stimulate apoptosis) or GADD34. The increase in elf2α levels inhibits further translation (red inhibitory arrow). (C). Illustrates the ATF6 activation pathway. Activated ATF6 translocate to the Golgi body forming a transcriptionally active ATF6 to the nucleus, aided with S1P (site-1-protease) and S2P (site-2-protease), increasing chaperone and ERAD genes production.*

## Small Molecule Inhibitor or Activators Exploiting UPR Mechanism to Treat Breast Cancer.

UPR is a highly complex pathway, closely linked to cell proliferation and fate. Hence, UPR-targeting drugs should have high specificity with known pharmacodynamics. UPR modulation effects vary in different diseases, having either pro or anti-carcinogenesis functions. In breast cancer, UPR small molecule inhibitors or activators can be administered in combination therapy with existing breast cancer chemotherapies drugs to enhance their potency and sensitise resistant tumor cells or as a single treatment.

Specific to breast cancer, PERK-targeting drugs exhibit more promising therapy than IRE1-targeting drugs, showing higher therapeutic coverage and efficacy, inducing cell death and reducing relapses in TNBC cells such as in CCT020312 compared to MKC8866 compounds. Therefore, further studies on IRE1-targeting drug relapse mechanisms are essential before their administration in BC therapy.

More clinical trials should be carried out involving UPR-targeting drugs in multiple breast cancer cell lines and subtypes to uncover the mechanisms behind their pharmacodynamics and improve the potency of anti-breast cancer drugs. Currently, it remains unclear why certain PERK-targeting drugs like CCT020312 are more potent and can be administered as a single breast cancer therapy, unlike ISRIB and SAL003. Additionally, further ISRIB research may mark an outstanding achievement in effectively targeting all breast cancer cell lines while counteracting chemoresistance, but studies on UPR-targeting HER2 breast cancers tend to be discounted, and it is unknown if ISRIB can be administered in HER2 therapy like TNBC and EsR+ therapies.
