The mammalian Hsp90 chaperone is crucial for cellular homeostasis, influencing cell proliferation, survival, and apoptosis with the help of co-chaperones. Inhibiting Hsp90 can lead to cellular diseases, making it a promising target for treating conditions like neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. This review examines the role of Hsp90 and its co-chaperones, focusing on how inhibiting their activity affects protein clients and how this knowledge can be leveraged in the development of novel therapeuticsÂ approach.
