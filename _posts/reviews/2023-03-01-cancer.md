The Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) is a complex adaptive mechanism that regulates proteostasis in the Endoplasmic Reticulum. Under normal conditions, the UPR remains inactive but is triggered during ER stress, often due to the accumulation of misfolded proteins, an occurrence commonly associated with diseases like breast cancer (BC). Recent studies have highlighted the role of UPR in BC carcinogenesis with its three primary stress sensors: Ire1, PERK, and ATF6, playing key roles in regulating its signaling pathways. Emerging UPR-targeting drugs show promise as potential BC treatments, either as monotherapy or in combination with existing chemotherapies to prevent tumor relapse in resistant BC cells.  This literature review explores the pivotal role of UPR in BC development and progression while epxloring the therapeutic potential of UPR-targeting drugs as monotherapy or combination therapy, particularly IRE1 and PERK, for more effective anti-BC therapy.
